Usage: install.sh [--source | --link | --uninstall]

  (no option)   download the latest release and install it to $BIN_DIR
  --source      build from source instead (needs Rust 1.88+, git and a C compiler)
  --link        build this checkout and symlink to it, so later rebuilds are
                picked up without reinstalling (for development)
  --uninstall   remove funwordl from $BIN_DIR (statistics are kept)

Set FUNWORDL_BIN_DIR to install somewhere other than ~/.local/bin.
